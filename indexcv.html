    <p>Dear Recruiter,
      <br/>
      <pre>
        First of all, thank you for this opportunity. I am 31 years old and I am graduate in Production
  Engineering, in which I received merit and certified for my excellent performance.

        The Production Engineering course is designed to prepare the student to act at all stages of a
  company from the beginning with the planning and product design, production of the same, quality control,
  manufacturing processes, and can also act in the area of finances, marketing or even sales.

        I have a great experience with the public, I manager events and shows, that needs a lot of you. In my
  own company, I was able to deal with my customers all the time, dealing with problems and resolving in the
  best way. In my company, I always had to have the logical reasoning very fast to solve problems of logistics,
  accounts, and clients.

        Among all my skills emphasize technical profile of an engineer along with a resourcefulness of a
  customer approach, the ease to communicate, easy adaptation to different types of environments, hard-working,
  drive and dedication to work and not less important, a person who is always looking for good results, both
  career and life. I donâ€™t speak Dutch yet but I am striving a lot to learn.

        Why should you hire me? Well, I had my own company in Brazil,that I could learn and see how to separate
  all process and optimize, gaining more time in the production and thus increasing the profit of the company,
  I must say that the marketing project that I did for this company made the company better seen by consumers.
  A person who leaves his comfort zone looking for a better career, is, without a doubt, a person who faces
  any type of challenge.

        Having said all that I considered important and other information in the curriculum vitae, I end
  this letter with a wistful appreciation for the opportunity to introduce myself.


                                                                                Best Regards, Danyelle Grillo

                                                                            Amsterdam, September 10 of 2018</pre>
